# Project Description

## Overview
The project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system for detecting toxic comments in Bengali social media content. With the increasing usage of social media platforms by Bengali users, there is a growing concern about the presence of offensive and harmful comments. This project aims to address this issue by implementing various machine learning models and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Problem Statement
Bengali social media users frequently post status updates, comments, and other content, which may contain negative or toxic language. Manually filtering out such toxic comments is a laborious task, especially given the unstructured nature of social media text and the prevalence of misspelled words and slang. The goal of this project is to develop automated systems for detecting and filtering out harmful remarks in Bengali social media content.

## Approach
The project utilizes supervised learning models such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression, along with deep learning-based models like BanglaBERT and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). These models are trained on annotated datasets of Bengali social media comments to classify them as toxic or non-toxic.

## Implementation Details
- **Dataset:** An annotated corpus of Bengali social media comments is used for training and evaluating the machine learning models. The dataset is stored in a CSV file.
- **Model Training:** Machine learning models are trained using Python libraries such as scikit-learn for traditional algorithms and TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models.
- **Evaluation:** The performance of the trained models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Frameworks:** Python frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are used for model implementation and training.

## Conclusion
By leveraging machine learning and NLP techniques, this project aims to provide an automated solution for detecting toxic comments in Bengali social media content. The results of the model evaluations will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing the problem of online toxicity in Bengali language text.
